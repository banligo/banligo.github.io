yeah，我又到办公室了。今天周二，下星期就要发表了……怎么办。学qft的事情还是先停一停吧。还是想先多学一些再开始做具体的研究。

学长人真好。嗯。虽然很像和他好好聊一聊，但感觉没什么契机，感觉也没有到合适的时机，接触的时间其实也不长。但是以后应该会渐行渐远吧，总是要分开的。

总是感激生命中遇到的都是对我有耐心的人。这样一个慢热又不健谈的人，大家总是对我无限的包容，明明做了这么多不着调的事情。以后也不知道干嘛，总是迷茫，但是要前进。

感谢。

时间好像定格在2020年18岁那年，然后就是一片空白。总是回忆。然后不断告诉自己，向前看，向前看。中学时期多读些书就好了。小学就玩就行。

今天啥也没干……光想事去了，好烦 😫

唉 😮‍💨 伤心。

Although very exicited that Prof. Hu replied me, I still don't know how to deal with the coding. sucks. 

I plan to stop computing, and focuse on the study, rather than "research". and I'll use English and Chinese (and Japanese??) to write the daily log one time by time. 

I like him. maybe. I felt tired and 迷茫 recently. about him. it influent me a lot actually. 

I don't want this website to be discover by anyone except someone I share with. 

I finally know why Kuramoto-san doesn't like Cosmology... I don't like too. Actually, I don't like particles. too complicated. maybe because there is too many numerical result and approximations. I want to learn gravity. maybe. not sure. I think I should not default myself what should I learn and should I do. Learn diversity. ... . I don't know what I like. .. . .
